This error occurs when you try to use a component before it's been fully rendered or defined.  It often happens with functional components that have asynchronous operations, like fetching data from an API. The component might try to access props or state before they've been populated, leading to the error.

```javascript
// Incorrect Component
function MyComponent() {
  const [data, setData] = useState(null);
  useEffect(() => {
    fetch('https://api.example.com/data')
      .then(response => response.json())
      .then(data => setData(data));
  }, []);

  return (
    <View>
      <Text>{data.name}</Text> // Error: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'name')
    </View>
  );
}
```
